This [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) package allows you to safely read
passwords from standard input in a console application.

You can build the documentation with `cargo doc` or [view it online](https://docs.rs/rpassword/).

I'd appreciate feedback if you use this library :-)

## Usage

Add `rpassword` as a dependency in Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
rpassword = "1.0.0"
```

Use `rpassword` within your code:

```rust
extern crate rpassword;

fn main() {
    // Prompt for a password on STDOUT
    let pass = rpassword::prompt_password_stdout("Password: ").unwrap();
    println!("Your password is {}", pass);

    // Prompt for a password on STDERR
    let pass = rpassword::prompt_password_stderr("Password: ").unwrap();
    println!("Your password is {}", pass);

    // Read a password without prompt
    let pass = rpassword::read_password().unwrap();
    println!("Your password is {}", pass);
}
```
